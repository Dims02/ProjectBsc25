## 🎯 Objectives

- Create and manage compliance-focused surveys.
- Automatically generate personalized recommendations.
- Provide a secure and accessible system for users and administrators.
- Export results in both **PDF** and **JSON** formats.
- Ensure compliance with cybersecurity best practices.

## 🚀 Features

### Administrator Interface
- CRUD operations for surveys and questions
- Toggle survey visibility
- Manage user permissions
- Edit recommendations
- View dashboards and analytics

### User Interface
- View and complete surveys
- Navigate across survey sections
- Analyze responses with visual charts
- Export responses and recommendations

### Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- SQL injection and XSS protection
- HTTPS and secure session management
- Cloudflare DDoS and bot mitigation

## 🧰 Technologies Used

| Category      | Stack                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Frontend      | HTML, Tailwind CSS                 |

| Database      | MySQL                              |
| Server        | Apache (XAMPP for dev, Fedora for prod) |
| Security      | JWT, bcrypt, HTTPS, Cloudflare     |

## ⚙️ Development Environment

- **XAMPP** (Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin)
- **OpenSSL** for HTTPS
- **Firefox** for browser testing
- Hosted on **Okeanos** (EU IaaS cloud)

## 📂 Database Schema Overview

The platform uses a normalized relational schema with the following core tables:
- `users`
- `surveys`
- `question_groups`
- `questions`
- `options`
- `recommendations`
- `responses`

## 📈 Example Workflow

1. Admin creates a survey with multiple groups of questions.
2. User logs in and completes the survey.
3. Platform analyzes answers and provides:
   - Level of compliance (basic/intermediate/advanced)
   - Recommendations based on performance
4. User exports results to PDF or JSON.

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- Secure login and session handling using JWT
- Prepared SQL statements
- Encrypted password storage (bcrypt)
- HTTPS for all communication
- Cloudflare to mitigate bots, DoS and DDoS attacks
